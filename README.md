# Procedural water surface
This is a procedural simulation of the structure of a water surface. The method used is from "Simulating Ocean Water" 
by Jerry Tessendorf.  

Below are three images showing what the result looks like. We see that there are waves going from the lower left corner to the upper right 
wave going from the left side to the right side.
